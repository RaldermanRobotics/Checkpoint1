Should work through section 3 of the gazebo course. The transmisison was a rough section for material

will need to add inertia calculations.... i think it is the following
M/2 * r^2 for the cylinder... not sure what i need more... maybe for each wheel too. 

another caluculation of moment of inertia for a spoke and wheel
I=I(of wheel)  + I(of spoke)
I = MR^2 + (1/3)ML^2

M=(mg)/g 

L=r
meaning that the spoke length is equal to the radius of the wheel.

simpler moment of inertia calculations:
for a cylinder I=(m/2)*R^2


curious as to the type of joint for the caster wheels... used fixed in the module... weird to me.
